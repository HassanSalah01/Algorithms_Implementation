# Selection Sort  : ( Time Complexity = O)(n2) 

<br>

# 

### arr = [ 2, 1, 3, 0]
<br>
We First Start With 2 (First Element ) And Loop Into The Arr Till We Find A Smaller Number Than The 2 

<br>

## IF we did : we Swap them So the new Array will be :

<br>

## [0 , 1 , 3 , 2]

<br>

## We keep Doing This Process Till The Array Is Sorted
